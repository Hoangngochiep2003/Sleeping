# 💡 Driver's Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV-Python

🤔 Ever fallen asleep while driving alone? 

🤔 Ever saved yourself from any accident by waking up instantly and looking in the side mirror and thanking god, because you hadn't completed your sleep?

🤔 Did you ever think to have someone who will give you an alert while you are feeling drowsy?

😉 Python comes for the rescue here!

👉 I made a python script that will give an alert to the driver when the driver is feeling drowsy

## 💡 Implementation of the Logic

👉 Basically, I used the famous dlib library which can estimate the location of 68 coordinates (x, y) that map the facial points on a person’s face in real-time.<br>
You can download the library from <a href="https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Driver-s-Drowsiness-Detection-using-OpenCV-Python/tree/main/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat">here.</a>

**📸 Here is a Image to show 68 points on our face**

**🎥 Here is a GIF to show 68 points on Real face**

<img src="assets/68_points_gif.gif" height=300px><br>


👉 Then, I am calculating Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) of Left Eye and Right Eye using Euclidean Distance between 3 pairs of different coordinates of both the eyes as seen in 68 Points landmark's image!

👉 Then, I set a threshold value, If EAR goes below that threshold point, It will alert the driver!

👉 Planning to integrate Lips Detection Algorithm also, to detect the driver is yawning or not!

👉 I am thinking to deploy it on a raspberry pi that will have an alarm attached to it so it can be really helpful to someone

## ⚡️ How to Use

Just follow 4 simple steps:

1. Clone repository to preserve directory structure<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Nisarg1112/Driver-s-Drowsiness-Detection-using-OpenCV-Python.git`
2. Go to your favorite code editor and open Command Prompt (cmd) amd go to directory where you cloned this repo
3. Run this command in cmd<br>
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `face_eye_detection_for_drowsiness.py` and Enjoy😎!
   
**Note**: Incase, if you want to just detect the 68 points on Human face then run `face_landmark.py` file and You are good to go!😎
